Java 8 ships with several new features but the most significant are the following:

Lambda Expressions − a new language feature allowing treating actions as objects
Method References − enable defining Lambda Expressions by referring to methods directly using their names
Optional − special wrapper class used for expressing optionality
Functional Interface – an interface with maximum one abstract method, implementation can be provided using a Lambda Expression
Default methods − give us the ability to add full implementations in interfaces besides abstract methods
Nashorn, JavaScript Engine − Java-based engine for executing and evaluating JavaScript code
Stream API − a special iterator class that allows processing collections of objects in a functional manner
Date API − an improved, immutable JodaTime-inspired Date API
